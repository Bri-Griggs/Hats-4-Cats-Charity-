<p> Hats 4 Cats is a charity that just for $4 a day you can give a hat to a cat.
    For every donation given, a prisoner in a correctional facility that participates 
    in an animal rehabilitation program involving cats makes a hat for a cat. Animal
    rehabilitation programs are so successful that prisoners are so excited to find
    more ways to bond with their animals and show and introduce them to love and trust as most 
    sheltered cats are common to come from backgrounds of abuse and mistreatment. These
    programs teach the cats socialization meanwhile Hats 4 Cats focuses on helping prisoners bond
    with their feline fur babies and of course make the cats more fashionable. Animal rehabilitation 
    programs have come to be met with not so much a positive stigma from many meanwhile the program has 
    come to prove very successful, hats for cats means to help prisoners show empathy for our feline friends
    and help prove how successful the programs are.

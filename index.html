<h2>Why go for Hats 4 Cats?</h2>
<div class="text2">
<p>First off, your cats will look flyer in front of their cool cat friends!</p>
<p>Think of how they'll make someone's day because who isn't happy seeing a cat in a hat?</p>
<p>Hats are actually better for long hair cats because it keeps their fur from painful mats and tangles.</p>
<p>If your cat is seen a little far away from your house, their hat will let others know they are not a stray.</p>
<p>Not only will the hat give away that cats are owned but you can put your information in their hats just in
case they stray too far.</p>
<p>Hats will keep cats warm or make a fashion statement.</p>

of some of our happy hatted furbabies!</h3>
